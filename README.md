# OperatingSystemsLabs
 Assignments for Java III.

# Description
 These are various assignments written in C for class focused on operating systems. There are a few C programs that demonstrate basic concepts and logic: payroll.c, sort.c, and sum.c. The reamining programs emulate several operating systems commands in Linux: my_cat.c, my_grep.c, my_wc.c, and grsh.c. The grsh.c program was the final project for the class.
